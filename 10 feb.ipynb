    "The open() function is used to open a file in Python. It takes two arguments: the file path and the mode in which the file should be opened. The file path can be a relative or absolute path to the file. The mode specifies how the file will be accessed. There are several modes available for file opening:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r': Read mode. This mode allows reading from the file. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, it raises a FileNotFoundError.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w': Write mode. This mode allows writing to the file. If the file exists, it will be truncated (emptied). If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a': Append mode. This mode allows appending data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x': Exclusive creation mode. This mode creates a new file but raises a FileExistsError if the file already exists.\n",
